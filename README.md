# GoalsApp

An app for users to manage their Goals using <b>React Native</b> .<br>

I got the idea from my first App using Vanilla Javascript Todo List where users can add an item to the lists and then can delete any of them, the same with Goals, user can Add, Remove goals.

## User Journey 

Users can write a goal by pressing a button and can Remove a goal by just pressing on it, That's It .<br>
